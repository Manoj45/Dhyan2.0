    <h2>GSAT-30</h2>
    <p>India telecommunication satellite GSAT-30 was successfully launched into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) on January 17, 2020 from Kourou launch base, French Guiana by Ariane-5 VA-251.GSAT-30 is configured on ISRO enhanced I-3K Bus structure to provide communication services from Geostationary orbit in C and Ku bands. The satellite derives its heritage from ISRO earlier INSAT/GSAT satellite series.</p>

    <h2>LVM X/Care Mission</h2>
    <p>LVM3-X/CARE Mission, the first experimental suborbital flight of India's latest generation Launch Vehicle- LVM3, lifted off from Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota, on December 18, 2014 and injected the Crew Module CARE at an altitude of 126km. The Crew Module splashed down near Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal about twenty minutes after lift off. The Crew Module was recovered by the Indian Coast Guard. This flight of LVM3 had a passive cryogenic stage.</p>

    <h2>Mars Orbiter Mission</h2>
    <p>Marking India's first venture into the interplanetary space, MOM will explore and observe Mars surface features, morphology, mineralogy and the Martian atmosphere. Further, a specific search for methane in the Martian atmosphere will provide information about the possibility or the past existence of life on the planet. The enormous distances involved in interplanetary missions present a demanding challenge; developing and mastering the technologies essential for these missions will open endless possibilities for space exploration. After leaving Earth, the Orbiter will have to endure the Interplanetary space for 300 days before Mars capture. Apart from deep space communications and navigation-guidance-control capabilities, the mission will require autonomy at the spacecraft end to handle contingencies. Once India decided to go to Mars, ISRO had no time to lose as the nearest launch window was only a few months away and it could not afford to lose the chance, given the next launch would present itself after over 780 days, in 2016. Thus, mission planning, manufacturing the spacecraft and the launch vehicle and readying the support systems took place swiftly.</p>
